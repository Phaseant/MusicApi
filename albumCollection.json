		"description": "Conceived during West’s self-imposed exile following the 2009 VMA incident and further influenced by his deteriorating relationship with model Amber Rose, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a genre-bending masterpiece that explores the darker sides of celebrity, fame, and love. Widely acclaimed by both fans and critics, it received a near impossible 10/10 rating from Pitchfork Media. Several of its songs, along with the record itself, appeared on numerous “best of 2010” lists, and the album won the 2012 Grammy for Best Rap Album. \nIt received a 94/100 score on Metacritic and later appeared on numerous greatest albums ever made lists.",

		"description": "Graduation is the third studio album from Chicago rapper Kanye West. The album was inspired by stadium tours, indie rock and house-music and was a huge departure from the sound Ye had used on his first two studio albums The College Dropout and Late Registration which featured samples and inspirations from soul and orchestral music. This album, on the other hand, included a much more electronic sound, featuring the use of layering synthesizers. Lyrically, Kanye analyzes himself and talks about his life after becoming famous and how he is criticized from the media.\nThe album famously faced off against 50 Cent’s Curtis in a sales war which Kanye won with 957,000 copies sold in the first week.\nSome critics argue this is the day gangsta rap was finally defeated.",

Four days later, the album would leak in a file-sharing website. Which did not effect the album’s release in it’s entirety.\nIn April 2016, Kanye West reportedly began updating Yeezus, like he did with The Life of Pablo.",

Just like its selection of samples, TESTING plays host to a far-reaching list of contributors. The most unexpected guests include FKA twigs and MGMT, who both help to make “Fukk Sleep” the waking-dream of a space-trap cut that it is. Elsewhere, Dev Hynes adds his nostalgic-R&B Blood Orange vibe to “Hund43d.”\nThe album is also extremely personal at times. On “Purity” he raps about losing loved ones in his life, and on “Changes” he ponders on his previous relationships.",

This choice stirred up some controversy, as some believed that the album should not be considered a rap album and the nomination was racially motivated.",

This helped propel bands like the Smashing Pumpkins and Green Day from the underground to global superstardom.",

The band eventually made a standard CD release and a deluxe-edition box set available in most countries during the last week of 2007.\nWithout a doubt, In Rainbows is one of Radiohead’s most orchestral records.
